It is recommended to fertilize the plants with a balanced fertilizer at planting, and then apply additional fertilizer in the spring and early summer.Proper irrigation is also important for the health of strawberry plants. They require consistent moisture, but should not be waterlogged. Mulching around the plants can help to conserve moisture and prevent weed growth.',
